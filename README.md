# KavitaBot
### Repository overview

Project KavitaBot: This project was born from Kavita not having any type of real SSO option. I needed a way for my Discord users to generate their own invites, and so KavitaBot was created! Currently it only accepts the /invite command, however I am planning to work on command groups and further integration with the Kavita API to enable new features.

### Environment Variables:

KAVITA_OPDS_URL – The full OPDS URL from and account in your Kavita with appropriate priveleges.

DISCORD_BOT_TKN – The token of your discord bot.

DISCORD_SVR_ID – The ID of your Discord server to enable forced sync update.

DISCORD_CHAN_ID – The channel ID where you want the bot to accept commands.

DISCORD_ROLE_ID – The user role ID you want to be required to use the bot.
